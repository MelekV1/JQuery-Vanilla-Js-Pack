      <b>The People Who Care</b>
      <br><br/>
      "There are some people out there…<br/>
       And it doesn’t happen a lot. <br/>
       It’s rare. <br/>
       But they refuse to let you hate them.<br/>
       In fact, they care about you in spite of it.<br/>
       And the really special ones, they’re relentless at it.<br/>
       Doesn’t matter what you do to them. They take it and care about you anyway. <br/>
       They don’t abandon you, no matter how many reasons you give them. <br/>
       No matter how much you’re practically begging them to leave.<br/>
       And you wanna know why?<br/>
       Because they feel something for me that I can’t… <br/>
       They love me."<br/>

       <b>The Code Of Chaos</b>
       <br><br/>
       “What if changing the world was just about being here,<br/>
        by showing up no matter how many times we get told we don’t belong,<br/>
        by staying true even when we’re shamed into being false,<br/>
        by believing in ourselves even when we’re told we’re too different? <br/>
        And if we all held on to that, if we refuse to budge and fall in line, <br/>
        if we stood our ground for long enough,<br/>
        just maybe… <br/>
        The world can’t help but change around us.”

        "I do see the beauty in the rules,<br/>
        the invisible code of chaos hiding behind the menacing face of order."
